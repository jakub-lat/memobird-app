# Memobird App

Unofficial app for Memobird G2 inkless printer.

The original app is not working anymore and has been taken down from Play Store, so I decided to make one myself. 
Made in [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) because I wanted to check it out (iOS isn't supported yet).

Shout out to [LeMinaw/openmemobird](https://github.com/LeMinaw/openmemobird) for providing API "docs".
